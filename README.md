# Getting_and_cleaning_data-Project

Repo for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

# Project summary

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Additional Information

You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
